# Circular Orbital Simulation

This Simulink model calculates and simulates the dynamics of a satellite in a circular low Earth orbit.

## Model File
- `orbital_speed.slx` - The main Simulink model created using Simulink Online.

## Results
The simulation confirms a constant gravitational acceleration of approximately 7,910 m/sÂ² for an orbit at 400 km altitude.
